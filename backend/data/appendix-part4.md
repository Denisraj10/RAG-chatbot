### 3\. Cost Modeling Framework

The implementation costs for all AI solutions are categorized into three primary components, following a structured framework that ensures transparency and accountability.

1

#### Development Costs

- • Software development (internal and external resources)
- • Model training and fine-tuning
- • Testing and quality assurance
- • Project management

2

#### Infrastructure Costs

- • Cloud computing resources
- • Storage and database services
- • API and integration services
- • Security and compliance controls

3

#### Integration & Training Costs

- • System integration
- • Data migration
- • User training and change management
- • Documentation and knowledge transfer

#### Year-by-Year Cost Projections

##### Year 1: Initial Implementation

- • Highest investment (40-50% of total 5-year cost)
- • Focus on development and infrastructure setup
- • Initial integration and training

##### Year 2: Enhancement & Expansion

- • Moderate investment (15-20% of total 5-year cost)
- • Feature enhancements based on initial feedback
- • Expanded user training and adoption

##### Years 3-5: Maintenance & Optimization

- • Lower ongoing investment (10-15% per year)
- • Maintenance and performance optimization
- • Incremental feature additions

#### Cost Reduction Methodology

##### Shared Foundation Model

- • Custom LLM serves as foundation for all solutions
- • Shared infrastructure reduces per-solution costs
- • Common data pipeline and storage architecture

##### Phased Implementation

- • Sequential development reduces parallel resource requirements
- • Lessons learned from early implementations reduce later costs
- • Gradual capability expansion rather than big-bang approach

##### Build vs. Buy Analysis

- • Strategic use of third-party components where appropriate
- • Custom development only for core differentiating capabilities
