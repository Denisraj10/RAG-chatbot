### Key Strategic Bottlenecks \[80/20 Analysis\]

Applying the 80/20 principle identifies the critical few bottlenecks hindering TREHEL's growth and efficiency:

#### 1\. External Partner Coordination (A&E, Subcontractors)

Consumes ~60% of PM time, causes delays, and introduces errors. This is the single largest operational drag.

AI Opportunity: Coordination Hubs automate tracking, communication, and prediction, freeing up significant PM capacity and reducing friction.

#### 2\. Expertise Scaling for Geographic Expansion

The inability to replicate the core "math problem solving" pre-construction expertise beyond the 90-mile radius directly limits the primary growth strategy.

AI Opportunity: Pre-Construction Digital Twin captures and scales this expertise digitally.

#### 3\. Knowledge Capture & Transfer

Reliance on key individuals (like Greg Blinstone for mentoring, Will Huss for pre-con strategy) creates risk and limits scalability.

AI Opportunity: Custom LLM & Digital AI Twin systematically capture and distribute organizational knowledge.

#### 4\. Process Standardization

Inconsistent approaches across PMs lead to variability in quality, efficiency, and documentation, hindering scaling efforts.

AI Opportunity: Process Standardization Framework provides AI-guided workflows for consistency.

Addressing these four bottlenecks through the proposed AI solutions unlocks the majority of the projected value ($28M-$45M annually).
