### 1\. Trehel's Strategic AI Gap Analysis

### Introduction

Following our in-depth research and analysis of Trehel, this section presents a comprehensive evaluation of the identified AI gap. We will outline a strategic approach to bridge this gap and quantify the significant opportunities available for capture. Below, you'll find a summary of the key elements underpinning this assessment and proposed strategy.

### Current State

- **Geographic Limitation:**

90-mile radius constrains growth potential & mission impact.
- **Expertise Bottleneck:**

- **Coordination Burden:**

PMs spend 60% of time on subcontractor and A&E coordination, limiting strategic focus.
- **Process Variation:**

Inconsistent processes across project managers hinder scalability and quality control.
- **Manual Reporting:**

Time-intensive financial and operational reporting delays insights.
- **Error Costs:**

$4.8M annually in error-related costs impacts profitability and reputation.
- **Knowledge Silos:**

Valuable expertise remains tacit and difficult to transfer or scale.

#### AI Transformation

###### Initial Entry

Leverage existing client relationships expanding into new states. Focus on core project types where TREHEL expertise is strongest.

###### Capability Demonstration

Use AI-enabled pre-construction accuracy and operational efficiency as key differentiators.

###### Relationship Building

Establish local presence (minimal initially, supported by AI) and build relationships with key subcontractors and partners.

###### Mission Alignment

Emphasize community transformation focus to attract clients and talent aligned with TREHEL's values.

###### Data-Driven Targeting

Utilize market data and AI insights to identify highest-potential projects and clients.

##### Phased Expansion Approach

###### 1\. Validate Model (Phase 1)

Prove the AI-enabled expansion model in 1-2 adjacent, lower-complexity markets. Refine processes based on learnings.

###### 2\. Scale Incrementally (Phase 2)

Expand to additional adjacent or strategically close markets. Increase project complexity and volume. Solidify operational processes.

###### 3\. Establish Regional Presence (Phase 3)

Achieve target 6-state presence. Optimize operations for multi-state management. Build regional brand recognition.

###### 4\. Evaluate Further Expansion (Beyond)

Assess success against the "40-state vision" based on performance in the initial 6 states. Develop strategy for broader national reach if warranted.

### 9\. Value Realization Framework

#### Framework for Tracking & Ensuring AI Value Realization

A structured approach is essential to ensure the projected $28M-$45M annual value and 483x-517x ROI are achieved and sustained. This framework focuses on continuous measurement, validation, and improvement.

##### Value Tracking KPIs

A balanced scorecard approach will track KPIs across four dimensions:

| Dimension | Key KPIs | Measurement Frequency | Primary AI Solution Impact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Financial | • Revenue Growth (Overall & New Markets)<br>• Project Margin Improvement<br>• Error Cost Reduction<br>• ROI Achieved (Solution & Portfolio)<br>• Cash Flow Improvement | Monthly/Quarterly | All Solutions (esp. Pre-Con Twin, Financial Analytics) |
| Operational | • PM Coordination Time Reduction<br>• Schedule Adherence Rate<br>• Subcontractor On-Time Rate<br>• A&E Response Time<br>• RFI Turnaround Time<br>• Process Consistency Score | Weekly/Monthly | Coordination Hubs, Sub Mgmt, LLM, Standardization Framework |
| Strategic | • Geographic Markets Entered<br>• Market Penetration Rate (New Markets)<br>• AI Solution Adoption Rate (Internal & External)<br>• Knowledge Capture Progress (%)<br>• Bid Win Rate Improvement | Monthly/Quarterly | Pre-Con Twin, LLM, Coordination Hubs, Sub Mgmt |
| Mission & People | • Mission Alignment Score<br>• Community Transformation Projects Delivered<br>• Employee Engagement (Mission Focus)<br>• Client Satisfaction (CSAT/NPS)<br>• Talent Attraction & Retention Rates | Quarterly/Annually | Mission Impact Analytics, All Solutions (via efficiency gains) |

##### Measurement Methodology

###### Baseline Establishment

###### Automated Tracking

Leverage AI solutions (e.g., Financial Analytics, LLM insights) for automated data collection where possible.

###### Manual Tracking

Implement clear processes for tracking metrics not automatically captured (e.g., PM time allocation surveys initially).

###### Regular Reporting

Integrate KPI tracking into regular operational and executive reporting cadences.

###### Dashboard Visualization

Create a Value Realization Dashboard for transparent monitoring.

##### Validation Approach

###### Data Audits

Regularly audit tracked data for accuracy and consistency.

###### Qualitative Feedback

Supplement quantitative KPIs with feedback from PMs, field staff, clients, and partners.

###### Correlation Analysis

Analyze correlations between AI solution adoption and KPI improvements.

###### Control Groups (where feasible)

Compare performance of AI-enabled projects/teams with traditional approaches during transition.

###### Third-Party Review (Optional)

Consider periodic external review to validate methodology and results.

Note: This framework will be further detailed and operationalized during the initial implementation phase. See Part 3, Section 4 for more on Value Tracking & Realization processes.
