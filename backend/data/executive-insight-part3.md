### 5\. Next Steps & Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (60-90-120 Days and beyond)

A structured plan for the initial phase of the AI transformation journey, focusing on building momentum and demonstrating early value.

This strategic roadmap provides a clear, actionable path for TREHEL's AI transformation journey. By following a structured approach that balances quick wins with foundational development, TREHEL can realize immediate value while building toward transformative capabilities. We recommend the model of hiring a fractional Chief AI Officer, as this will provide the technical support required to enable the different stages, while eliminating the overburden of having to hire a full-time employee. This approach offers executive-level AI expertise at a fraction of the cost, accelerates implementation timelines through specialized knowledge, and provides objective third-party guidance without the overhead of permanent headcount. The fractional CAIO model has proven particularly effective for mid-market companies like TREHEL that need sophisticated AI leadership without the expense of a full-time executive.

### Strategic Implementation Approach

#### Parallel Implementation Strategy

TREHEL will pursue a dual-track approach to maximize both immediate value and long-term transformation:

- **Track 1:** Quick-win implementations that deliver immediate ROI
- **Track 2:** Foundation layer development that enables future capabilities

This approach ensures continuous value delivery while building toward transformative capabilities.
